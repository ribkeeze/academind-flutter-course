# 🎯 Flutter Learning Journey – Academind Course

This repository showcases my progress while taking **_Flutter & Dart – The Complete Guide_** by **Maximilian Schwarzmüller (Academind)**.  
Each folder corresponds to a section from the course, demonstrating different Flutter concepts through real-world mini-apps.

## 📎 About This Repository
Each folder contains:
- The full source code for that section’s app  
- A self-contained Flutter project (`pubspec.yaml` included)  
- Screenshots or assets demonstrating UI design and behavior  

This structure allows others (and future me!) to clone and explore individual concepts quickly.
